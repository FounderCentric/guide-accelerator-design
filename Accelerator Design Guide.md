**Credits:** Our approach to accelerator design, and thus this guide, would have never found its feet without my initial conversations with Jan Matern of Emerge, Jon Bradford and Sean Kane - then, of Springboard, now Techstars - and John Spindler of Capital Enterprise.  Since we launched Founder-Centric, I've been influenced by other iconoclasts like Paul Orlando of AccelerateHK, Bobby Patterson of Searchcamp, and the work our own Jordan Schlipf has lead with truly innovative corporate accelerator programmes like Diane Perlman and Zack Weisfeld at Microsoft, and Conrad Poulson at Orange. 

I hope this conversation expands to include others so that we can learn from each other. And I hope this guide evolves on that basis, helping us all keep pushing the envelope.

# Accelerator Design Guide
It’s tough to design a programme to accelerate entrepreneurs; their paths aren’t set, their preferences are unknown and their needs aren’t predictable.

As the accelerator industry blossoms, the same is true for accelerators themselves.  

The accelerator model is being applied in far more diverse contexts, like creative businesses, industry verticals, corporate R&D, and new markets.  The standard accelerator model doesn't always apply - programmes must be redesigned, and lessons learned are valuable to share.
 
This guide covers a set of guiding principles, specific design tool and techniques - and a set of questions to help frame your design decisions.

Founder-Centric has been intrinsically involved in over 20 accelerators and 4 universities, mainly delivering attitude-shift and getting teams to traction with a more practical, time-sensitive approach to workshops.  

We'll also share lessons from our own accelerator projects in farther reaching contexts, like accelerators for freelancers, emerging markets, and corporates with strategic goals that don't involve startup equity.

## Guiding Principle: Being responsive rather than predictive
Your teams are all capable, and all on different paths. Rather than try to predict their needs, we want to be responsive. We want to be helpful when they need us. We want to get out of the way when they need to execute.

We recommend an enabling, responsive approach, rather than trying to predict their
needs or impose a procedure.

It's easy to imagine how teams will progress through each week of your accelerator, learning from customers, mentors, investors, building a product, then learning to pitch; and we can even envisage how we can move from one topic to the next, week by week. All very orderly.

In reality, it's herding cats. Every team will choose its own path, and attempts to predict their needs beyond the first few weeks cause frustration. If you've run an accelerator before, you've experienced how founders retaliate against scheduled activities they don't find helpful. They just want to get on with their company.

Often, it makes sense to schedule placeholders for workshops and mentors, so founders can schedule their lives around those times without conflict, and you can fill them with relevant help as needs arise.

### Tip: Don't mix up scheduling with predicting
Accelerators tend to waste time dealing with schedule conflicts, push-backs from frustrated founders, and chasing founders. 

This friction often comes from a disconnect between the accelerator's pre-conceived expectation of founder needs, and the immediate needs themselves.  

Beyond the first few weeks, we recommend scheduling place-holder workshops where the content is not yet defined. 

An easy compromise is to schedule placeholders - where the time and place is set in advance, but the content can be changed closer to the day. This makes sure workshops are as relevant as possible at the time, but still allows teams to schedule their activities, like travel and meetings.

On a similar note, scheduling accelerator activities on specific days of the week to allow for weekly business trips if necessary.

### Tip: Give them time to apply what they've learned
Many programmes are keen to load up founders with as much education as possible - often all up-front.  

We've found that knowledge retention and *application* suffer in these cases, because teams don't have time to apply what they've learned. 

Don't overload teams with education at the outset. An initial toolset can be helpful, but for teaching to take hold and demonstrate a return on your investment, it needs to be applied and ideally assimilated into your teams modus operandi.  This takes time, so consider spacing out education.


### Tip: Seek attitude shift over methodology adoption
When we started Founder-Centric, we thought we were hired to teach founders about Business Model Generation and Lean Startup.  What we learned is that our true value comes from attitude shift, where founders understand and apply the principles, rather than go through the motions with the tools.

In the early part of the program, help
founders build their toolset, but beware that insisting on any specific tools or methodologies can have unintended consequences on their team dynamic and relationship with you.  Methodologies often take time to get right - time the team doesn't have to spare.  Principles, on the other hand, are easily grasped and rallied-around.

Just like there's a difference between learning to be a hacker, and learning how to program, there's a difference between learning to be founder and learning how to "do Lean Startup."  Both can be taught, but one is more effective.

### Tip: Maintain an evolving timeline 
Using cards or post-its, set out a week-by-week timeline for your program, trying different sequences of modules. Always consider the sequences from the founders perspective. Give founders tools early, and leave wiggle-room to adapt to their needs later.  Keep this schedule in the same place throughout the programme - adapt as necessary.

We've created a free card deck to help with this: Founder-Centric Programme Design Cards.

## Guiding Principle: Be clear on what 'accelerates'
### What does accelerated mean for your teams?
From the founders perspective, what goal or milestone can we make happen sooner? The standard accelerator model takes the onward funding round as that goal - bringing it to 3-months instead of 12+-months.

For your startups, the goal doesn't have to be a funding round, but it should be a founder goal that is clearly defined such as an early client, a loan, or a validated business model. It doesn't even need to be objective or measurable, as long as you can somehow evaluate it. A clear definition of this goal will help make other design decisions, and will be the bedrock for improvement with every cohort.


### What lead-time can you lower?
If wheels spin for a team for more than a week, the accelerator is likely to fail them. 

Before the program, consider the aspects of getting to market where teams will struggle with long lead-times. Often, this is in making connections, both customer and industry, but frequently enough, its some form of education or attitude-adjustment which needs time to set in before they can take full advantage of what you have to offer.

It's your job, as an accelerator, to shorten these lead times to days and hours. This means a lot of time over-invested in getting resources, connections and knowledge at the ready.

A key point to remember here is that optimising the programme around reducing lead time *for teams* can necessitate wasted effort for the accelerator.  Getting 5 leads ready when the startup only acts on 2 is better than only one lead or 2 leads, a week later, because the startup progresses at an accelerated rate.  The time investment for the acclerator pays off.

When the program starts, it's prudent to reevaluate these needs with your teams, letting them lead the discussion. A Post Up is useful way to do this.

### What wheel-spinning can you reduce?

With their noses to the grindstone, it's often tough for teams to look up and realise all their hard work hasn't moved them forward.  With the tight time constraiints of an accelerator, if even a week are two are wasted in this way, that means a large enough gap in momentum that they're unlikely to have the exit velocity required to succeed in the accelerator. 

The hard part is maintaining frequent, open and structured-enough contact with teams so that you can catch this.  Building in peer support mechanisms can help here (more on this below) as can a foosball table. We've found that a special type of reglar meeting can help too, where we simply ask them how it's going on their own terms (not the terms we'd like to impose) and ask where we can help and what's taking longer than exepected.  With 20 minutes once per week, we can get a sense if they're struggling in a number of specific areas - customer empathy, metrics, product, go-to-market, introductions, iteration speed - and flag up specific actions or help we can bring in to unblock them.  We can also compare our notes week-on-week, using a simple paper tool we've designed called [The Cohort Report](https://github.com/FounderCentric/tool-cohort-report).

### What defines progress? What attitude and culture do you want around this?
Some kind of regular check-up usually helps give you insight into their progress – but consider the tone and focus of these. If they're reporting on up-and-to-the-right metrics, these will turn into corporate presentations, where the teams feel they are "reporting to their boss," only sharing the good news, and leaving out more ambitious goals to show they're acheiving their targets.

If you're looking for founders to make frequent course-corrections, for example, it makes sense to ask them to report on learning goals. A metrics focus tends to lead to optimisation activities, whereas learning goals keep the focus on fundamentals.

So it's worth considering what truly defines progress - is it traction? learning? growth? - so your questioning and reporting mechanisms instil the desired culture.

You'll notice the culture will form fairly quickly as the cohort coalesces. There are some ways to influence this:

1. To some degree, this will be driven by a few alpha founders. Be wary of strong personalities that oppose your ideals during selection - they can counter-act your desired attitudes across the cohort.  
2. Plant seeds in terms of story-telling and hero worship.  Ask in founders for dinner to share their war stories.  Ask them to be inclusive - welcoming the cohort to their club. Read biographies of founders you'd like to see emulated - and tell "did you know?" stories.  Print posters with startup advice, or even imgur memes if appropriate. Get strong quotes printed as vinyl decals for you wall - like in museums.
3. Be sensitive to your own behaviour, especially in the first few weeks of the programme.  It's worth being clear and direct in terms of expectations from the outset. My typical advice is, "You're all expected to multiply your valuation by 5 or more in the next 90 days. This means you'll have to aim for big leaps and learnng every week - if you're stuck on something for 2 weeks, you're probably a goner. You'll have to get rid of lead times, like waiting for customers or advisors to reply - put the programme to work by asking for the connections you'll need. And you'll be expected to support each other, spot when another startup is stuck and dislodge them." If you catch yourself reprimanding or commanding teams, you'll risk ending up with a primary-school dynamic with your teams, rather than a one that emphasises taking responsibility and being open.  




## Guiding Principle: Design for the information you need to respond.

Certain tools and formats allow us insight into their choices and progress. We use this
information to respond to their needs, whether
implicit or explicit.


## Guiding Principle: Peer-support
We like to setup a peer-support culture, focused on learning progress, so the teams hold themselves accountable.

We remain closely involved, both casually and through group Braintrust meetings and 1-on-1 check-ins, which are designed to spot wheel-spinning and opportunities for the accelerator to shorten lead-times. (We've found this is at the heart of acceleration.)

These flag up problems that are easily resolved via intros, resource, or help from you. In some cases, yoou can help un-block your teams by pulling in a relevent workshop or expert.


### How can you get teams to support themselves?
When a team spends more than a week stuck on the same problem, that's a warning sign. If they spend two weeks, it's critical. Three weeks, and the vultures are circling – it's unlikely they'll achieve the acceleration goal.

As much as we'd like to think stand-ups, weekly meetings or playing table football will help us spot these problems, it's the founders peers who naturally have this insight. No matter how cool you are, you'll always be bad cop to their good cop.

Installing a culture and structure of peer-support that focuses on avoiding wheel-spinning can help. How can you do that? (If you'd like, check out Braintrust, a peer-support format we've developed over the last 3 years.)

## Approaches to Design
### Just Do It, then Iterate 
Whether starting an accelerator for a region, or a particular vertical, or a type of founder, these accelerator directors simply hit the ground running, with a view that the important changes will come from experience after the first cohort.

They generally stick to the standard 3 months, with round-robin mentoring, and a demo day at the end.

What they discover, other than general structural improvements to the program, are who and how they can help best. So next time, they have a more specific sense of who qualifies and why, adapting their model around their investment thesis. I've seen programs shift selection and support towards a B2B, sports-only, emerging trends like Internet Of Things, or particular tech stacks, but only after it was clear this made sense from actual startup progress.

This is learning that can only be acted on at the end of cohort #1, so the directors know getting their ASAP is a worthy goal. They say hindsight is 20/20, so better get some hindsight!

### Challenge The Model
A lot of program directors challenge the standard 3-month + demo model from the outset. Paul Orlando at AccelerateHK originally tried a range of program lengths, iCatapult in Budapest added 9-months of post-demo day support, Searchcamp focuses on educating founders, Collective Accelerator gives access to free debt rather than taking equity.

Many programmes have challenged onward funding as the main goal, focusing on a rapid field trial or enterprise client #1 instead. This is particularly happening in industry-specific accelerators – engineering, medical, cleantech, finance, education.

Others have moved away from equity-based funding models altogether, benefitting instead from knowledge-exchange, PR, and partnerships.

## Tip: get help!
Founder-Centric is rooted in the startup community, and we've chosen a business model that allows us to stay true to that.  We only charge for delivering workshops, and keep our content open so you and others can deliver it too. 

This means we can always spend some time to help you with program design, and we're happy to put you in touch with other accelerator directors.

If you have the chance, join us for a retreat, where accelerators, universities and business support people come together to trade notes themselves.
