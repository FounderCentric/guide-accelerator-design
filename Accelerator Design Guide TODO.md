# Notes

---

---
Founders often make similar mistakes when pitching,
skipping information thatâ€™s needed for a proper evaluation, or
over-selling rather than internalising the feedback.
Give each evaluator a stack of bingo cards, so they can
simply hand them to the presenter after the pitch.
The founders then have a tangible take-away of what
aspects they need to improve to move the investor or
programme relationship forward.

# Notes: To-do
When does the wall of noise make sense?
Lead-time - connections, like at Camden/Emerge
mentor community
blue ocean

disruption

- fragmentation: education, tools, demo/mentor days, capital, brand - general loosening of the defined structure of an accelerator

1. experience
2. inclusive / non dogmatic
3. charisma

corp -
strategic intrsstss - wellness, iot

Telefonica
- good people being stopped
- non-evidence based since evidence-based section was wrapped in politic-based decision making

Dealflow
- power law theory
- selection is based on quantity of applications theory
- f6s, angel list
- pressing the flesh (emerge getting 
- using jordi's deep metrics to understand where the best deals come from
- eleven iterating on selection criteria (b2b) based on who they can help most
