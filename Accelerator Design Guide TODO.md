# Notes

---

---
Founders often make similar mistakes when pitching,
skipping information that’s needed for a proper evaluation, or
over-selling rather than internalising the feedback.
Give each evaluator a stack of bingo cards, so they can
simply hand them to the presenter after the pitch.
The founders then have a tangible take-away of what
aspects they need to improve to move the investor or
programme relationship forward.

hands-off
youre recruiting teams better than you
touch them just enough to keep them excited

positive peer pressure
'casual braintrust'
set the culture as 'what did you do last week?'
everyone brings their computer
every conversation happens over dinner, showing what you did

sense of urgency and momentum, peer pressure because other teams

solve every problem, by finding better founders

partner incentives - avoid negative signalling

trances and follow-ons doom the other teams

# vertical vs horizontal accelerators

Two accelerator design approaches I admire
by Salim Virani 
on Sep 24th, 2013
I've worked with 20 accelerators over the last year and I've noticed two approaches I admire, Just Do It and Challenge The Model.

New YC Partner Investment Policy
by Paul Graham
As of this batch we're introducing a new policy for investments by YC partners in the companies we fund.

YC partners have invested in the startups we fund since the first batch. In the beginning it was harmless, and occasionally even necessary. And other investors couldn't treat investments by YC partners as much of a signal when I was the only one doing it, because I was so haphazard about it. But over the years this gradually changed, as there came to be more YC partners and they paid more attention to picking likely winners, till by the last couple batches, other investors could treat investment by YC partners as an accurate sign of how promising we thought a startup was. Which meant we were now making it harder for the startups that partners didn't invest in to raise money.

Our new policy is designed to prevent this by depriving other investors of this signal till it's too late. The new rule is that YC partners can't be in the first $500k a company raises, unless it's 3 weeks past Demo Day. And since a startup's fundraising trajectory is almost always established, one way or another, by 3 weeks after Demo Day, this should mean that we can't affect anyone's fundraising unless they've raised $500k, at which point their fundraising is already successful.

Prototype Day

Prototype Day is one of the best days of YC. It’s like a mini Demo Day. The order of the companies is randomly chosen and every company has a few minutes to present. It’s early on and you still don’t know most of your batchmates all that well. Prototype Day lets you learn about what everyone is doing and a little bit about every person in your batch.

The partners tell you not to prepare. However, we found preparation to be focusing, and we chose to put together a presentation. We used that as an exercise to figure out how we would pitch our idea and company to a large group of people.

After each presentation, PG tells the company’s founders some of the things they did wrong. It’s useful, although it’s best not to be randomly chosen to go first or second. It’s your first introduction to how investors might react to your pitch.

Prototype Day ends in a vote. Every founder gets to vote for two companies, then the vote is tallied, and the top ten companies are announced. I can’t find any of the published results of any past Prototype Day, so I don’t want to give any results, but we did fine.

Dinners

YC hosts a dinner with a prominent startup founder (or Ron Conway) every Tuesday evening. The talks are interesting — more inspiring than informative. A frequent theme is how to not get screwed by your venture capitalists. YC dinners are off-the-record, so I won’t share any of the details of the talks we experienced, but they’re enjoyable.

The most significant value of the Tuesday dinners is that it’s the one time each week when YC turns into a co-working space. Companies arrive hours before dinner. You have many of your office hours for the week, you chat with Kirsty or the Levys (YC’s two lawyers) about a random question you have, you catch up with everyone in the batch, and you get as much user feedback as you can get in the hours before dinner starts.


One-on-ones / Office Hours

Group presentations

## ITNIG
## YC

Group office hours happen every two weeks. Our group partners were Paul Buchheit, Kevin Hale, and Kirsty. Group office hours are like regular office hours, except they’re public and shared. Each startup takes a turn giving an update and interacting with the partners. This is useful because it allows you to see the problems that others are facing (and also how they solved them!).

# Fundraising and investor relationships

http://blog.zactownsend.com/going-through-y-combinator-s13-nine-lessons-learned

> Fundraising Too Early Before Demo Day

> YC tells you to avoid doing it in the first two months. We did it too early. It was a mistake. In fact, we screwed up our entire fundraising process. Three friends told us that normally people who mess it up so badly can’t recover; we somehow still raised a healthy seed round. I’d say we fucked the whole thing up, except we did end up with millions of dollars. If I ever find the time, I’ll write another post on what not to do, but YC is right: don’t raise money until you’re ready.

> I think that the ideal time is likely about two weeks before Demo Day; at that point you may or may not feel ready, but you’re going to have to be so it’s time to start acting like you are. People ask on Demo Day how much money you’ve raised, and the answer shouldn’t be zero. But if the answer is that you closed the round (or that you got too many “No"s, too early), then that might be just as bad.

> Rehearsal Day

> Roughly a week before Demo Day you have a Rehearsal Day where every company goes through their initial pitch. Every company presents, there is a vote at the end, and you get in-stream advice. In fact, this time PG will just interrupt you with advice. This is the beginning of a week long sprint that culminates with Demo Day.

> You have to practice this presentation so much that, despite its being scripted to the word, down to the second even, you sound perfectly natural. This proved not to be a strong point of mine. I can give good, if not great, off-the-cuff presentations — in fact, I relieved my stress by giving everyone else’s presentations (sometimes in a joking tone) and helping batchmates come up with new phrasing, new ideas, new ordering, etc. But getting down the exact wording that I agreed to with PG? That took me all week.

> Demo Day

> The night before Demo Day is Alumni Demo Day in the same venue; I did not do well. I felt like I spent every single waking moment between that and our presentation on Demo Day practicing. I walked to the Computer History Museum from our Mountain View house giving the presentation to myself over and over and over again.

> I think the first time I gave the presentation perfectly on stage was on Demo Day itself. It was a good time to peak.

> When not presenting at Demo Day, you are surrounded by investors. It’s ten solid hours of answering questions, discussing valuation, and trying to close some deals.

> It was exhausting. It was exhilarating. But that’s YC for ya.
