# Notes

---

---
Founders often make similar mistakes when pitching,
skipping information thatâ€™s needed for a proper evaluation, or
over-selling rather than internalising the feedback.
Give each evaluator a stack of bingo cards, so they can
simply hand them to the presenter after the pitch.
The founders then have a tangible take-away of what
aspects they need to improve to move the investor or
programme relationship forward.

Notes from @robfitz interview

# YC 
Weekly dinners
copy did 2x a week, and more mentorsr

hands-off
youre recruiting teams better than you
touch them just enough to keep them excited

positive peer pressure
'casual braintrust'
set the culture as 'what did you do last week?'
everyone brings their computer
every conversation happens over dinner, showing what you did

sense of urgency and momentum, peer pressure because other teams

solve every problem, by finding better founders

partner incentives - avoid negative signalling

trances and follow-ons doom the other teams

# vertical vs horizontal accelerators

conrad - rolling acceptances, 

## quarterly get togethers
seedcamp academy


moats and resources
- hacker news, of course you apply to yc, everyone has you as their homepage


power law

best in category
industries - k12
local
customer connection, market - *Rose's accelerator, Germany - paid in media

fred wilson - both sides of the table - blogs

yc doesn't use external mentors or teachers, just 12 partners

alumni network vs mentor network

hookups to pr, investors, credibility

pg was the only point of contact, now lead partners

grab office hours if you want someone else

3 horus dinner
hour show and tell
hour talk with food
hour chatting with the bigwig

#ef rolling demo days
continued to support bad ones

# hackfwd
demo day retries / in progress snapshot

brought investors in as mentors  blurring mentoring/investing


* carlos - why did they change their mentor day format?

quarterly intakes
partners make investment decisions
vet trusted mentors, as referrers
mentors coach the team up to a credible level, then make the intro

accept team son a rolling basis

2-5d event every quarter, mentoring, demoday

a year of support

* lars - postmortem - every industry - games was hard


#yc
jessica acted as the team's mom. don't worry about legals, etc. here, sign this, make this call. incorporation, banking, etc. doing it with you - 1 hour time cost to teams total.

getting pissed off at teams because you didn't provide the support


# on site vs offsite
don't get distracted


# moats
ycnews
industry connections
k12 US - US Charter Schools
BGV - gov't connections
Seedcamp - events around Europe
Celebrities - 500 Startups
MIT/Stanford?
37Signals/Tim Ferris - tribes
Tech Stacks - RoR, PhoneGap, Telerik
Techstars - brand for dealflow, powered by partnerships, multiple locations for expansion (and MS)
YC - almost all partners have been through YC, 
YC - almost all can code




Two accelerator design approaches I admire
by Salim Virani 
on Sep 24th, 2013
I've worked with 20 accelerators over the last year and I've noticed two approaches I admire, Just Do It and Challenge The Model.

# Notes: To-do
When does the wall of noise make sense?
Lead-time - connections, like at Camden/Emerge
mentor community
blue ocean

disruption
- corp
- low-end
- new markets
- fragmentation: education, tools, demo/mentor days, capital, brand - general loosening of the defined structure of an accelerator

1. experience
2. inclusive / non dogmatic
3. charisma

corp -
strategic intrsstss - wellness, iot

participate not observe

intro reference to yc ts

friction - telefonica/orange
		
support from other accelerators

intros
@corp.com email  address
access to clients
backing startups with enterprise clients with corp support

Telefonica
- good people being stopped
- non-evidence based since evidence-based section was wrapped in politic-based decision making

Dealflow
- power law theory
- selection is based on quantity of applications theory
- f6s, angel list
- pressing the flesh (emerge getting 
- using jordi's deep metrics to understand where the best deals come from
- eleven iterating on selection criteria (b2b) based on who they can help most
- branding
- seedcamp's mini seedcamp tours
-

The Demo Day Is Dead


Workshop design
- storytelling
- inclusive
- actually moves them forward, strips away hype and process

New YC Partner Investment Policy
by Paul Graham
As of this batch we're introducing a new policy for investments by YC partners in the companies we fund.

YC partners have invested in the startups we fund since the first batch. In the beginning it was harmless, and occasionally even necessary. And other investors couldn't treat investments by YC partners as much of a signal when I was the only one doing it, because I was so haphazard about it. But over the years this gradually changed, as there came to be more YC partners and they paid more attention to picking likely winners, till by the last couple batches, other investors could treat investment by YC partners as an accurate sign of how promising we thought a startup was. Which meant we were now making it harder for the startups that partners didn't invest in to raise money.

Our new policy is designed to prevent this by depriving other investors of this signal till it's too late. The new rule is that YC partners can't be in the first $500k a company raises, unless it's 3 weeks past Demo Day. And since a startup's fundraising trajectory is almost always established, one way or another, by 3 weeks after Demo Day, this should mean that we can't affect anyone's fundraising unless they've raised $500k, at which point their fundraising is already successful.
