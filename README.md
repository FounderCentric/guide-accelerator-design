# Accelerator Design Guide

This guide contains tips and prompts to help design an accelerator programme that's *responsive* to founder needs.  It's based on our experience with around 20 European accelerators.

*Note:* This is a work in progress. If you'd like to dig a bit deeper, please feel free to look in the (TODO)[https://github.com/FounderCentric/guide-accelerator-design/blob/master/Accelerator%20Design%20Guide%20TODO.md] file for notes.

We'd like to improve this guide based on your feedback, so please (get in touch)[mailto:salim@foundercentric.com] with any questions, suggestions or comments
